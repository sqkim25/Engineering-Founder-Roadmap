  <h1>10-Year Training Roadmap for an Elite Engineering Founder</h1>
</header>

<main>

  <p>
    This comprehensive roadmap outlines a decade-long, self-directed training program to develop a
    world-class engineering founder capable of integrating physics, hardware, software, operations,
    leadership, and strategy. The plan is structured in multiple layers of competencies, with curated
    courses, hands-on projects, real-world experiences, and personal development milestones for each
    year.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is to cultivate a leader who can build mission-critical deep-tech companies (think SpaceX,
    Anduril, Tesla, OpenAI infrastructure) by mastering a full stack of technical skills and developing
    the resilience and leadership acumen to execute under pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each competency layer includes learning objectives, subskills, real-world examples, evaluation
    metrics, best-in-class courses, curated textbooks, and escalating hands-on projects. Recommended
    internships/apprenticeships at elite organizations are aligned to each stage. A year-by-year
    breakdown ties everything together, specifying what to focus on, key milestones, and how to recover
    from setbacks.
  </p>

  <p>
    The roadmap is designed to be actionable and references real courses and industrial practices at every
    step so a highly motivated self-learner can follow it. Progression is rigorous—comparable to a
    combined top-tier university program and professional apprenticeship—because developing an elite
    engineering founder is a 10-year marathon of continuous learning and doing.
